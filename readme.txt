I used the HTML% Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS validation services and I had no errors. There is a validation logo on my webpage. I placed the css file in a subdirectory and is a seperate .css file. I used my assignment 2 html file and designed it with CSS. I have a Navigation panel, and two columns below that. One column contains the content and the other column contains a picture of me. I had to use FLEX to make sure the column background color aligned with each other. I checked on diffrent browsers to make sure it was working on all of them.
